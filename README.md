### Introduction

This package acts like an add-on to the [Twitter Ads SDK](http://twitterdev.github.io/twitter-python-ads-sdk/). It is designed to make Twitter
Ads Analytics requests more simple by doing two things:

* Performing multiple asynchronous request and retrieval to the Twitter Analytics endpoint 
* Aggregating and transforming responses into a `list` of mappings that include id, date and campaign name

The mappings are daily records: 

`{campaign_name:'', 'id':'', 'date':'', metric_1:'', metric_2:'', metric_3:''}` 

This makes importing into a database very easy :thumbsup:.
